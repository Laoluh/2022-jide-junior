									<h3><a href="digital.html"#>Digital Education in Nigeria.-The way Forward </a></h3>
									<span class="posted_by">Aina Olaoluwa</span>
									<p> <br><br><h3>The Digital Gap</h3> Education and skills acquisition in the world at this point in history is taking a new shape. As what is relevant education is changing just like every sector of our today world. While there exists a deficit in education delivery in Africa, we must now be watchful of a possible further decline of the educational situation, as the definition of quality education is rapidly taking a new form.
										Although the private sector in education seems to be doing so much to make up for the deficit in the delivery of education in Nigeria, there still exist a great margin in the delivery of education. Factors like affordability, lack of funding, insecurity among others still largely affects the efficiency of the educational sector. <br><br><h3>The Digital Revolution</h3>
										ICT is no doubt the tool for reshaping the future, and undeniable is the increasing demand for digital skills, in the global market place.  As the world has become a global village and demand for efficient labor has grown so much that it has broken international boundaries. Mac-Ikemenjima D. (2017) Harnessing the Potential of ICT for Education. (a multi stakeholder approach) 
										While opportunities abound in this ever-growing labor industry, we must begin to empower the next generation with the necessary skill set for relevance in this emerging industry. Also not forgetting the fact that ICT is gradually becoming useful for day-to-day problem solution development, with the potential to breach the gap in the delivery of education in the exploding population and alleviate poverty.
										Over time Nigeria has witnessed a transition in the form of digital education delivery mostly focused on the education of adult individuals. actions such as the resuscitation of 1985 suspended national open university and establishment of several digital education initiatives is no doubt a great attempt. However, there is little progress in the areas of primary education and access to learning enabling technology, for the successful implementation of digital education. 
										<br><br><h3>Ideological Solutions</h3> Ideologies that are focused on inclusiveness in digital education, such as the Owerri Digital Village, which includes teens and kids in the course programs needs to be replicated massively across the nation, making the access to digital skills widespread. Similarly, course curriculums should include relevant skills that are now in demand, in order to equip the next generation for the future of cross border opportunities and overall societal development. 
										Although efforts of government and civil societies have been over time focused on building the Enabling facilities the necessary infrastructure still suffers quite a huge setback as the available facility is largely inadequate. Also, where there is availability of facilities there is a common challenge of lack of experienced manpower in management and education delivery at such facilities. Largely there also seems to be an unspoken dedication to the traditional mode of education, making adaptation to new technology difficult.
										Most importantly we need to realize that there exist a continuing disconnect that must be addressed and treated as both an economic and educational challenge as more importantly covid 19 has shown the more need to get digital. All hands and minds need to be on deck for the emancipation of the African future through digital education. <br><br><h5>Sources:</h5>
