									<h3><a href="sickle.html"#>Superstitions And Sickle Cell Anemia</a></h3>
									<span class="posted_by">(Aina Olaoluwa) Nov.  2021</span>
									<span class="comment"><a href="">21<i class="icon-bubble2"></i></a></span>
									<p> <br><br><h3>The Worrisome State of Affairs</h3> Sub Saharan Africa has 75% world annual sickle cell births. a trend that needs a lot of attention from government end citizens. Sickle cell anemia a disorder of the hemoglobin which leaves the carrier with a vulnerable immune system, making them frequently sick, and frequently requiring medications for the boost of their immune, mostly folic acid for the continuous boost of blood levels. 
										According to the World Health Organization WHO, 300,000 children are born yearly with sickle cell anemia and that 5% of the world population carries traits of hemoglobin disorders. Sub-Sahara Africa however has 75% of annual births of hemoglobin disorder. Nigeria is responsible for 150,000. Births bearing 66% of the entire sub-Saharan figure. Majority of the children born with the disorder die before age 5 as a result of blood loss or infection. 
										<br><br><h3>The Misconception </h3>
										In Africa there has exists a belief that is age long and transcends cultures and boundaries, although called different names in different locations the ideology remains the same. Founded on traditional beliefs, children who are born and who experience the known symptoms of sickle cell anemia are regarded as evil children who only came to make their parents unhappy because they will eventually return (die) at an early age, before the parents can even find joy in their birth. A concept rooted in traditional religion which has birthed the occasion of certain cruelty to children, sometimes in forms of bodily deformation (marks, burns etc.). discrimination is another major effect of these belief, children considered sickly are often discriminated and easily bullied and jested for their inability to participate in certain strength demanding activities. They are perceived as weak and evil and only came to make their mothers cry. 
										This concept is however founded upon unreasonable grounds as science has exposed. Many of the carriers of the hemoglobin disease are discriminated on these grounds. There is a large ignorance on the subject matter of the genotype, many are not informed about the disease and a lot are still unbothered especially in the rural environments where there is still low education delivery.  Since the marriages are conducted without a sound understanding of the genotype concept or even knowing their status, there occurs a possible reoccurring birth of children with the disease, the children are then ignorantly termed as the same child reincarnating to go through the same process over again. Hence the reason for the cruelty based on beliefs that they are trying to prevent a return (death) of the child. (Called Abiku in Yoruba cultures)

										<br><br><h3>The Way Out   </h3> 

										To reduce the outrageous rate of Sickle Cell Disease, a lot has to be done on the part of government, firstly on providing better welfare attention to the victims of the disease, in terms of provision of drugs as the drugs are not yet free, similarly awareness and sensitization about the disease and the cause needs to be carried out massively with special focus on the rural regions, to reduce stigmatizations and illiteracy about the disease. Although NGOs have been at the fore front of this sensitizations there is need to have more efforts put into the awareness to reduce the misconception and the over all alarming statistics.
