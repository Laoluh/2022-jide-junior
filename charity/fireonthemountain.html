									<h3><a href="fireonthemountain.html"#>FIRE ON THE MOUNTAIN</a></h3>
									<span class="posted_by"> (Aina Olaoluwa) Nov. 11th 2021</span>
									<p>We are faced with an increasing risk of Global warming. The COP26 comes to an end and governments are making applaudable promises as usual. However, there is an urgent need for the implementation of climate promises, especially by the developed world. The need to meet the 1.5 â€“ 2 degrees Celsius containing of global warming by 2030 is seeming not realistic with the current attitude of the world, reflecting a larger lack of awareness or consciousness of the nature of the situation. <br><br><h3>The Disturbing Reality</h3>
										The disturbing reality is that the generation that will be mostly affected by the effect of climate change is largely unrepresented in the decision-making positions as it is in the world. While all hands need to be on deck to save the already suffering planet, there is a lack of awareness/ lack of understanding of the nature of the situation especially in the developing countries where the reality of survival is still very much an important cause of worry. 
										Activities such as deforestation for cooking, logging and other activities are deemed as necessity for survival, hence climate protection campaigns do not receive a communal welcome as expected, since physical evidence is majorly lacking. There is fire on the mountain but caution is not been taken by the larger populace a margin of apathy that is worrisome. However, while there is a need for switch to cleaner fuel and need renewable energy, these societies are faced with challenges that do not make switch immediately possible which makes the spread of the awareness ineffective. <br><br><h3>Power Deficit </h3> 
										Data has it that 770 million people lack access to electricity, and that 75% of those people live in sub-Saharan Africa (International Energy Agency), and that it requires about $28 billion to fix the deficit in funding (International Energy Agency). A challenge that has a direct reflection on the expected level of carbon emission since the known available and affordable alternative for daily cooking activities are the non-renewable energy. 
								
										Similarly, activities such as gas flaring is a major contributor to the amount of climate pollution. Decisive and intentional actions need to be taken by governments in applicable regions where these activities are still common. Decisive policy actions need to be considered and implemented if the 2030 target must be met. As the promises that governments have made need to be taken seriously, it is time where those policy needs to be backed by deliberate implementation actions. Especially in the area of new infrastructure development, with consciousness of the possible future risks.
										<br><br><h3>The Need to Work Together</h3> 
										Although carbon pricing is becoming more relevant in the conversations around climate change, there is a need for the locals to understand the nature of this state of emergency, there is an increasing need to attract voluntary participation birthed out of understanding. The need to take the conversation along with solutions to the rural communities who majorly just understands poverty as a more immediate tret. Conversations that should be communicated in the language they understand as the effects of climate change now abounds but little or no attention is being given by the rural communities, despite the glaring evidence that include a distortion in the weather seasons, record heat and flooding. There is more attention given to superstition rather than scientific facts and evidence.
